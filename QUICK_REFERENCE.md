# 🎯 Quick Reference - Render Deployment

## ⚡ Super Fast Deployment (5 Minutes)

### 1️⃣ Push to GitHub
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
# Create repo on github.com, then:
git remote add origin YOUR_REPO_URL

## 🗄️ Database Access - YES YOU CAN!

### Method 1: DBeaver (Easiest)

**Download:** https://dbeaver.io

1. Install DBeaver
2. Go to Render Dashboard → epass-db
3. Copy connection details
4. In DBeaver: New Connection → PostgreSQL
5. Paste details → Connect

**What you can do:**
- ✅ Delete any pass: `DELETE FROM passes WHERE name1 = 'John'`
- ✅ View all data: `SELECT * FROM passes`
- ✅ Edit anything directly
- ✅ Export/import data
- ✅ Run any SQL query

---

### Method 2: Render Shell (Quick)

1. Render Dashboard → Your Service → Shell
2. Run:
```python
python
from app import get_db
conn = get_db()
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Delete a pass
cursor.execute("DELETE FROM passes WHERE name1 = %s", ('John',))
conn.commit()

# View passes
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM passes")
print(cursor.fetchall())
```

## 🆘 Common Issues

### Build Failed?
- Check GitHub has all files
- Check `render.yaml` exists
- View logs in Render dashboard

### Database Empty?
- Visit your app URL (auto-creates tables)
- Or run in Render Shell:
```bash
python -c "from app import init_db; init_db()"
```

### Camera Not Working?
- Render provides HTTPS automatically
- Check browser permissions

## 📊 Database Operations

### Delete all passes:
```sql
DELETE FROM passes;
```

### Delete specific pass:
```sql
DELETE FROM passes WHERE pass_id = 'xxx';
```

### Reset scanned status:
```sql
UPDATE passes SET scanned_at = NULL, scanned_by = NULL WHERE pass_id = 'xxx';
```

### View statistics:
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total,
  SUM(CASE WHEN scanned_at IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as scanned,
  SUM(amount) as revenue
FROM passes;
```
